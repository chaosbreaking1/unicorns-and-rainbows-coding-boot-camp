# unicorns-and-rainbows-coding-boot-camp
An easy coding boot camp for all!

CSZero Syllabus (beta test version 0.8.10)A curated, gamified coding boot camp.  This is a collection of free-ish (free or low cost)  interactive coding lessons, primarily coding games and  interactive tutorials supplemented with videos  and reading materials.  Unlike most coding curriculum which starts easy then rapidly ramps up in difficulty, Coding Quest has a gentle learning curve because of the integration of children's learning material and games that teach coding.  While this is a college level course, a 10 year old was able to complete the course.  Coding Quest can be completed in three months if you work it like 40 hours a week, full-time job. This course is highly hands on and based on doing more rather than reading/watching more.  The goal of the Coding Quest is to prepare for you for a job in web development.This is a JavaScipt curriculum but a Python version is being worked on (not ready). Hardware RequirementsYou need a laptop and a mobile device for this course.The minimum specs for a laptop are 8GB RAM and support one of these operating systems:MacOS X Yosemite (10.10)Windows 10Linux Debian based: Ubuntu Desktop 14.04, Debian 7Linux Red Hat: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, Fedora 23A laptop with 15.6" or bigger screen and 16 GB RAM or more is preferred.  Chromebooks are not recommended because they many do not support full version of Linux and furthermore they have ultra tiny storage storage spaces. The iPad is the best choice for a mobile device since it can run Swift Playgrounds (only on iPad not on iPhone or Mac), the best coding tutorial app.  If you do not have access to a mobile device, an Android tab emulator can work.  Pick one mobile device in order or preference:    Any iPad that that is manufactured within two years ago.  iPhone or Android phone. BlueStacks Android emulator for Win/Mac/Linux > https://bluestacks.app The Bluestacks emulator is virtual Android tab that runs on your computer.STUDENT EXPECTATIONSThis course has complex materials but has an easy learning curve.  If you ever get stuck, look online, especially YouTube for answers.  If you lookup the answers and still do not understand it twice in a row, then move on to the next after you look up the answers  covers a lot of content in a short amount of time: 10 WEEKS! Every 2-weeks a new module will appear - expect to spend at least 3-5 hours on each module. Announcements will be posted regularly to remind students of upcoming deadlines and course updates.
